  As long as you manage your zones as code, rebuilding your servers should be very straightforward.
  In RLabs, the authoritative servers of ext.lab are NS1 and NS2 and they are managed entirely by Puppet.

  Rebuilding them is as easy as clicking on "Build" button on Foreman.
  Do it on the node with the VIP to see how long it takes to the other node to takeover.
  After finishing the rebuild of one server, wait until Puppet configures it and then rebuild the other.
