  The Image server is just an NFS server exporting a directory to be mounted as a VMware Datastore.
  Rebuilding this server would obviously lead to Data Loss, as the HDD will be formated again.
  What we do to reduce the impact of rebuilding this server is to make sure that, once Puppet creates the exported directory, if itÂ´s empty, restore data from the backup server.
