# RLabs

This is a project to bring a virtual datacenter up with many common services with only one command.

Of cource we´ll have many milestones, but we won´t have sprints since we are not a team.

It will be a "best effort" long journey. The only thing I know is that IT IS possible.

Let´s start with our TARGET SERVICES <pending: put a link>, that will composed by many services running on different platforms and using load balancers, centralized log services, monitoring etc.
